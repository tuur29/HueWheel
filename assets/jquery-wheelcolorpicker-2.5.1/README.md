jQuery Wheel Color Picker Plugin
================================

The Wheel Color Picker plugin adds color picker functionality to HTML form inputs in round color wheel style. The Wheel Color Picker can be displayed as a popup dialog as users focus the input, or embedded inline. It currently supports these HTML elements:

*   input (works on buttons too!)
*   textarea

Note: It should also works on other HTML elements which support jQuery .val() function.

Features
--------

**SUPPORTED COLORS**

This plugin supports both RGB and HSV modes with additional Alpha channel.

**MULTIPLE FORMAT**

There are numbers of formats which the color picker can display its value:

*   **hex** format, e.g. ffffff
*   **CSS-style hex** format, e.g. #ffffff
*   **rgb** format, e.g. rgb(255, 255, 255)
*   **hsv** format, e.g. hsv(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
     
**INDIVIDUAL SLIDERS**

The color picker can be set to display slider for each individual color channel.

**THEMING CAPABILITY**

The color picker appearance can be customized using CSS. This package already contains two CSS variants which can be used as starting point to make your own theme.

See [Features Page](https://github.com/fujaru/jquery-wheelcolorpicker/wiki/Features) for the complete list.



Usage
-----

First, include these javascript and CSS files on the HTML head section:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.7.1.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.wheelcolorpicker.js"></script>
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/wheelcolorpicker.css" />
```

**HTML WAY**

Since version 2.3, an easier way to initialize the color picker is by simply adding `data-wheelcolorpicker` attribute to an input element.

```html
<input type="text" data-wheelcolorpicker />
```

And you're done!

**JAVASCRIPT WAY**

Or you can also initialize the color picker to an element by calling:

```js
$(element).wheelColorPicker( options );
```

**Example**

```html
<input type="text" class="colorpicker" />

<script type="text/javascript">
  $(function() { $('.colorpicker').wheelColorPicker(); });
</script>
```
